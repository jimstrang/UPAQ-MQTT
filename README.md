# UniFi Protect Air Quality → MQTT

A tiny bridge that pulls readings from one or more **Ubiquiti UP-AirQuality**
(Vape Detection & Air Quality Sensor) devices out of UniFi Protect and
publishes them to MQTT using **Home Assistant MQTT Discovery** — so each sensor
and its LED controls show up in Home Assistant automatically.

It exists because, as of mid-2026, the native Home Assistant `unifiprotect`
integration doesn't surface this device's data yet (the values stream over
Protect's WebSocket, but the `uiprotect` library doesn't model them). See
[home-assistant/core discussion #4047](https://github.com/orgs/home-assistant/discussions/4047).
Use this in the meantime; once native support lands you can switch over.

## What you get in Home Assistant

One Home Assistant device per adopted UP-AirQuality sensor, each with:

**Sensors** — CO₂, AQI, Vape Index, VOC Index, TVOC, PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4.0,
PM10, Temperature, Humidity (each with a `status` attribute, e.g. `neutral`).

**Controls** (config entities):
- LED Brightness (0–100) and LED Metric (Air Quality / CO₂)
- Status Light on/off
- Night Mode on/off and Night Mode Brightness
- Per-metric low/high alert thresholds

**Diagnostics** — Firmware Version, Firmware Update Available.

## Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose
- A UniFi Protect controller with one or more UP-AirQuality sensors adopted, and a **local
  account** on it (Owner/local user — not a UI Cloud-only login)
- An MQTT broker that Home Assistant uses (e.g. the Mosquitto add-on)

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tommo-101/UPAQ-MQTT.git
cd UPAQ-MQTT
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env            # fill in your Protect + MQTT details
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f  # watch it connect and publish
```

The entities appear in Home Assistant under **Settings → Devices & Services →
MQTT** within a few seconds.

Discovery includes both a stable MQTT identifier and the sensor's MAC address
as a Home Assistant device-registry connection. If Home Assistant already has a
UniFi Protect device with the same MAC connection, newly discovered MQTT
entities can attach to that existing device instead of creating a separate MQTT
device. If MQTT devices were already discovered before this metadata was added,
Home Assistant may keep the existing MQTT device because its MQTT identifier is
already registered; remove the duplicate MQTT device/entities and let discovery
run again if you want HA to re-associate them by MAC.

## Configuration

All config is via environment variables (`.env`):

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| `PROTECT_HOST` | yes | — | Controller IP/hostname |
| `PROTECT_USER` | yes | — | Local Protect username |
| `PROTECT_PASS` | yes | — | Local Protect password |
| `MQTT_HOST` | yes | — | Broker IP/hostname |
| `MQTT_PORT` | no | `1883` | Broker port |
| `MQTT_USER` | no | — | Broker username (omit for anonymous) |
| `MQTT_PASS` | no | — | Broker password |
| `DISCOVERY_PREFIX` | no | `homeassistant` | HA discovery prefix |

## How it works

`bridge.py` logs in, reads `/proxy/protect/api/bootstrap` for initial state,
then connects to Protect's `/proxy/protect/ws/updates` WebSocket and
republishes to MQTT on every change (event-driven, ~instant). Each discovered
UP-AirQuality sensor gets its own state and control topics based on its device
MAC, while all entities share one bridge availability topic for MQTT Last Will
handling. Control changes from Home Assistant are `PATCH`ed back to the
matching sensor.

## Notes & caveats

- **`ringLedMetric` mapping** is `0 = CO2`, `1 = Air Quality` (verified on fw
  1.0.12). If a future firmware differs, flip `LED_METRIC_OPTIONS` in
  `bridge.py`.
- **No NOx** is published — fw 1.0.12 doesn't expose a `nox` field despite the
  spec sheet. It's already mapped, so it'll appear automatically if added.
- **Alert thresholds** default to `null` (device defaults). HA can set a value
  but can't clear it back to `null`; reset those in the UniFi app if needed.
- If multiple sensors have the same Protect name, Home Assistant discovery
  appends a short MAC/id suffix to the duplicate device names. MQTT topics,
  object IDs, and unique IDs are always based on the device MAC/id, not the
  display name.
- **Security:** use a **dedicated** Protect local user and a dedicated MQTT
  user for this bridge, scoped minimally. Keep your real `.env` out of git
  (it's already in `.gitignore`).
- UniFi rate-limits logins; the bridge uses exponential backoff so a failed
  login can't storm the controller.
